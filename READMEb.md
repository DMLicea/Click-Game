* The Game

* * The purpose of this assignment is a simple memory-based clicking game using a React app.

* * The app renders 12 different images. Each time the user clicks an image, the order of the images reshuffle. The goal of the game is to click each image once. If the user clicks an image twice, they lose the game. 

* The Meat

* * The application should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

* * Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

* * The application should keep track of the user's score. 

* * The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 

* * The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* * Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
